## 🎯 How to Play

- Click a candy 🍬, then an adjacent candy to swap them.
- If the swap creates a row or column of 3 or more identical candies, they disappear with animations and sound effects.
- New candies fall smoothly to fill the board.
- Earn points per match (10 points per candy).
- Special candies:
```
. Match 4 candies horizontally to create a vertical striped candy (⬇️) that clears a column when activated.
. Match 4 candies vertically to create a horizontal striped candy (➡️) that clears a row when activated.
. Match 5 candies to create a color bomb (🌟) or a wrapped candy (🎁) for larger effects.
```
- Win a level by reaching the goal score within the move limit (increases with levels, e.g., 21 moves for Level 1, 23 for Level 2).
- After winning, press "OK" to start the next level with a higher goal and more moves.
- Sound effects enhance the experience: matches, special candy activations, level wins, and losses.

## 🌟 Future Improvements
